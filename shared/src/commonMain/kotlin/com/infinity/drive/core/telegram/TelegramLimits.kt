/**
 * Account-dependent Telegram limits.
 *
 * The size cap is derived from how an upload is actually carried: a part is at
 * most 512 KiB and there are at most 4000 of them, 8000 with Premium. That puts
 * the real ceiling at 2000 MiB and 4000 MiB, a little under the "2 GB" and
 * "4 GB" the apps advertise. A file in that gap looks acceptable to the client
 * and is then refused by the server with FILE_PARTS_INVALID, so the numbers
 * here follow the part arithmetic instead of being rounded to whole gibibytes.
