/**
 * Paces progress writes to one a second and reports the speed as an average
 * over that second rather than over whatever moment the last update landed in.
 *
 * Telegram reports bytes far more often than a person can read them, and a
 * reading taken over a fraction of a second swings with every burst, which
 * makes the speed and the time left jump about. Averaging the interval, then
 * easing the result into the previous one, gives a figure that settles.
